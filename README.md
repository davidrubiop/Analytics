# Analytics
Hi visitor, thank you for taking the time to review my GitHub.
This repository is home of some projects I developed during 
my Master's in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School.
In here, I proudly reflect my learning process on a variety of topics including:

* Data Science in Pytyon
* Data Science in R
* Text Analytics (Tokenization, Sentiment Analysis, N-gram Networks, Dashboards)
* SQL
* Machine Learning

As a complement, I also share my approach to projects from Datacamp and/or HackerRank platforms.

Feel free to contact me at any time: https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrubiop/

Sincerely,

David Rubio
